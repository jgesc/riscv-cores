# RV32I Single Cycle

First attempt at programming a RISC-V single cycle core in Verilog.

This core implements the RV32I instruction set.


## Requirements
 * Icarus Verilog with SystemVerilog (IEEE1800-2012) support (version 11.0 and above) for compiling the core.
 * RISC-V GNU toolchain to compile the test program


## Testing
`make test` to build the core and testing program and run it on the core.


## Results
